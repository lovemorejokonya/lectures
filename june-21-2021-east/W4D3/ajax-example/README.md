# AJAX Example using jQuery

HTML pages in this example are being served statically using ExpressJS.


### Getting Started

To run this example, please make sure that you run `npm install` in the main directory.

Once you've got all the dependencies installed, run `node start` or `npm start` to get the server up and running on port 8080 (by default).

All front-end code (HTML, CSS, and client side JS / jQuery) is placed in the `public` folder.
